# Cloud 9 IDE JavaScript Development Environment inspired by Cory House

This is a generic Cloud 9 IDE JavaScript development environment that I build from scratch in ["Building a JavaScript Development Environment" by Cory House on Pluralsight](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/javascript-development-environment/table-of-contents). This isn't tied to any specific JS framework.
